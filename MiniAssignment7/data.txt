An encyclopedia American English , archaic spelling, or encyclopaedia
British English is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or
 special to a particular field or discipline. Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that
 are often arranged alphabetically by article name and sometimes by thematic categories. Encyclopedia
 entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. Generally speaking, encyclopedia a
 rticles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title; this is unlike
 dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning,
 pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms
